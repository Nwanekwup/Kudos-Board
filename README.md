### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
- Yes the topics prepared me. the lecture video by Erica on the set up, prisma, migration, backend, and frontend implementations were helpful.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
-Yes, i would add stretch features.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- I learnt a lot of new implementations that also took time for me to implement but the outcomes were satisfying.
